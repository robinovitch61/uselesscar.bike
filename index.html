      <h2>What?</h2>
      <p>A 1971 VW bug converted to pedal power. No fossil fuel, no electricity, just human power. Both the driver and passenger can power the car by pedalling, but only the driver can steer and brake. 
        The vehicle weighs about 800 lbs empty (less than 1/4 the weight of an 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.epa.gov/automotive-trends/highlights-automotive-trends-report">average modern car</a>). It moves slowly.</p>

      <h2>Why?</h2>
      <p>Our world is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/resources/press/press-release/">quickly
        becoming too hot</a>. We are almost out of time to prevent irreversible damage to the
        planet and
        its inhabitants. The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-and-health">WHO states that</a>
        Climate Change is the biggest health threat facing humanity, and "<strong>the people whose health is being harmed first and worst by the climate crisis 
        are the people who contribute least to its causes</strong>, and who are least able to protect themselves and their families against it—people 
        in low-income and disadvantaged countries and communities".
      </p>
      <p>Many of us have the financial and societal means of choosing more efficient transport options,
        but don't. If this project gets just a few more people to consider, use, and advocate for car alternatives then I
        will consider it a success. Bikes (electric or manual), buses, trains, walking, handcycles, horses, rowboats,
        ferries, subways, dirigibles, and many other forms of transport use less energy per mile than personal cars.
        Individual
        action matters—live like your emissions matter, because they do.</p>
