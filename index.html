      <h2>What?</h2>
      <p>A 1971 VW bug converted to pedal power. No fossil fuel, no electricity, just human power. Both the driver and
        passenger can power the car by pedalling, but only the driver can steer and brake. The vehicle weighs about 800
        lbs empty. It moves slowly.</p>

      <h2>Why?</h2>
      <p>Our world is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/resources/press/press-release/">quickly
        becoming too hot</a>. We are almost out of time to prevent irreversible damage to the
        planet and
        its inhabitants. Many of us have the financial and societal means of choosing more efficient transport options,
        but don't. If this project gets just a few more people to consider and choose car alternatives more often then I
        will consider it a success. Bikes (electric or manual), buses, trains, walking, handcycles, horses, rowboats,
        ferries, subways, dirigibles, and many other forms of transport are more efficient than personal cars.
        Individual
        action mattersâ€”live like your emissions matter, because they do.</p>
