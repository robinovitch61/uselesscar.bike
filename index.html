      <h2>What?</h2>
      <p>A 1971 VW bug converted to pedal power. No fossil fuel, no electricity, just human power. Both the driver and passenger can power the car by pedalling, but only the driver can steer and brake.
        The vehicle weighs about 900lbs empty (or 400kg, about 1/4 the weight of an
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.epa.gov/automotive-trends/highlights-automotive-trends-report">average modern car</a>). It moves slowly and is a "useless" car.</p>
    </section>

      <h2>Why?</h2>
      <p><strong>I want people to experience how much effort it takes to move a car.</strong> Cars are ubiquitous in our society, yet we rarely stop to consider the physics of these machines.
        Modern cars are heavy and fast, and consume a lot of energy. Electric vehicles produce 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://environment.yale.edu/news/article/yse-study-finds-electric-vehicles-provide-lower-carbon-emissions-through-additional">fewer emissions</a> 
         than fossil fuel vehicles, but they still require a lot of energy compared to other types of transport.
      </p>
      <p>Our world is <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/resources/press/press-release/">quickly
        becoming too hot</a>, largely due to the burning of fossil fuels. If society continues to emit massive amounts of greenhouse gases we will cause irreversible damage to the planet and
        its inhabitants. The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/climate-change-and-health">WHO states that</a>
        Climate Change is the biggest health threat facing humanity, and "<strong>the people whose health is being harmed first and worst by the climate crisis
        are the people who contribute least to its causes</strong>, and who are least able to protect themselves and their families against itâ€” people
        in low-income and disadvantaged countries and communities".
      </p>
      <p>Many of us have the financial and societal means of choosing more efficient transport options,
        but don't. <strong>The goal of this project is to get more people to think critically about their energy consumption.</strong>
        Hopefully this leads to more people considering, using, and advocating for car alternatives. 
        Bikes (electric or manual), buses, trains, walking, handcycles, horses, rowboats,
        ferries, subways, gondolas, scooters, carpools, and many other forms of transport consume less energy per mile than personal cars.
